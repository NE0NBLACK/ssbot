# SSBot

A tool for making a twitter bot using Google Spreadsheets. Because the software runs in Google Spreadsheets, and it requires the interaction of a specifically-constructed sheet with the underlying code specific to that sheet, this GitHub repo exists mainly to point to the current version or versions of the spreadsheets.

The `.gs` files in this repository are the underlying GAS code for the dev version.
