# SSBot

A tool for making a twitter bot using Google Spreadsheets. Because the software runs in Google Spreadsheets, and it requires the interaction of a specifically-constructed sheet with the underlying code specific to that sheet, this GitHub repo exists 
 * to point to the current, legacy, and in-development versions of the spreadsheet
 * to share the underlying code in a canonical way
 * to use <a href="/issues">the issues tracker</a> for support and bug reports

The `.gs` files in this repository are the underlying GAS code for the dev version.
